    - [ ]  Solidity Q & A
        - [ ] On the LexToken contract. How does one enable the pez dispenser part where when you send to the token contract address ETH it spits back the ratio of the tkn?
        - [ ] I also still don't get this tbh.  uint256 ethPurchaseRatio = (wholeEth.mul(ethPurchaseRate)).div(decimalFactor);  To me where  uint256 decimalFactor = 10uint256(18);
        uint256 wholeEth = 10uint256(18); are both constants that cancel out, it leaves just the ethPurchaseRate
But I am sure I am missing something
